# Edgar-Allan-Poe-AiChatbot

##Overview

This is an AI text generator that operates similarly to how ChatGPT works using neural networks. It incorporates machine learning concepts such as Attention, Natural Language Processing and Transformers to train and produce text in the words of famous American writer Edgar Allan Poe as seen in the Generated.md file.


**Usage

Please download the aichatbot.ipynb and open it in a Jupyter Notebook to run on an external GPU. You may also prefer to download the aichatbot.py file along with the preprocessed_data.csv to run on your own GPU.


**Comments on the Output

The results were not the best as seen in the Generated.md file, but I believe that by increasing the batch size, block size, and number of levels in the neural network will lead to better results. I cannot attempt to do so at the moment as the gpu requirements would be higher than what I have access to and would take too long to train with what I have.
